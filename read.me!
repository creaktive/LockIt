        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        This program is a small and powerfull bomb program, or better saying,
a trojan horse program. When someone runs it on his machine, it sets
specified password (see chapter IV) to his machine's BIOS. So, when machine
will start up, it will ask password to user. If user don't know password,
he'll have a nice nightmare! Because, if he want to remove password by BIOS
setup, he'll can't do it, because BIOS setup is blocked, too! And he can't
use any software (even any one from boot disk!) to remove password, because
his system will not boot up!

        II). FuCKiN' uNSeCuRiTY
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        There are 3 things that lamah can do to save his computer:
1). Start trying all passwords to access his computer.
2). Enter any universal password.
3). Reset CMOS chip.
        Well, as you can see, in first case it will be really difficult to
find correct password, because there are 8^94 (7.770675568903E+84) possible
passwords.
 OBS.: This is not necessary to enter "BUTT" to open blocked AWARD
BIOS system blocked with password "BUTT", you can also type "5}z|", it causes
same results. The total number of DIFFERENT & NOT EQUIVALENT passwords for
AWARD BIOS is 256^2 (65536).
        Now, case 2. This one really suck's, man! If lamah knows universal
password (AWARD_SW, AWARD?SW, BIOSTAR, etc,) for his BIOS, he'll can access
his computer. But it is not much probable, that lamah will know universal
password: AWARD BIOS v4.51+ have different universal password, and I don't
know anybody that knows this one!
        And, finally, case 3. If case 2 suck's, case 3 fucks!!! It consists
in erasing all CMOS chip's data by hardware intervention. This one certainly
works! But don't worry, lamah can't do it himself! So, he'll call somebody
to repair his computer, and will pay him! Cool!
 OBS.: I heard, that last versions of AWARD CMOS chips can't be reset by
hardware intervention. I'm not sure, but if this is true, LET'S ROCK!

        III). HoW DoeS iT WoRKS?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Sorry, I can't show you C code for this program. This is my
"know-how". If you have necessary qualification, you can decompile LOCKIT.COM
to see, how it works. The code is very simple. But I can say about theory
of this program's work. Using the hardware ports (not connection ports, you
lamah! HARDWARE PORTS!), it accesses directly CMOS chip and updates data
contained on it. It updates password field and setup options' field. After
this, when computer starts, it will ask password!

        IV). HoW CaN i CHaNGe TRoJaN'S PaSSWoRD?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Remember, the default password is "WHiP_aSS"! But you can change the
password to be set by LOCKIT.COM using SETDOWN.EXE program. You can also
change LOCKIT.COM name to SEX_18.COM or FREEPORN.EXE; it works by the same
way. So, these lines will explain how to use SETDOWN.EXE to set password
"[unlock]" into LOCKIT.COM:

        Oh, yeah... These fuckin' bugs! They suck's!

* BUGS: *

I don't know anyone. If you'll find some, inform it to me or patch it and
send back to me!

* PROBLEMS: *

1). Main problem: THIS -=x[ LOCKIT ]x=- VERSION ONLY WILL HAVE SUCCESS ON
MACHINE THAT HAVE ANY AWARD BIOS! On AMI BIOS, for example, it will do
following trash:
a) Stores user-defined disk data at top of memory instead of 0030h:0000h;
b) Request F1 keypress on boot error enabled;
c) First Hard Disk becomes user defined: Write Precompensation Cylinder
changed to pseudo-randomic value.

2). Nothing appears to screen. Lamah can suspect something, even with his
0.023 milligram brain.

3). Computer doesn't restart to show changes to lamah. So, this program
becomes some kind of time bomb.

        VI). FuTuRe VeRSioNS
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Future versions of -=x[ LOCKIT ]x=- will have:

        - Support for not-AWARD BIOSes
        - EXE infector included
        - LINUX version (w/o SETDOWN/INFECT options)

Any comments/suggestions can be send to me by:
        E-MAIL:  stas@nettaxi.com
        ICQ:     11979567

But remember to not send me messages like:
"I'm a hacker!"
"I can make much better trojan! I'm a hacker!"
"Dude, didn't you know that your program can be very dangeruos?"
"Can you put my copyright on -=x[ LOCKIT ]=-? It may be: 'LamaSoft, 1998-1998'"
"Are you friend of Bill Gates?"
"Your site is very stupid!"

If you gonna send me this fuck, you'll receive MAIL or ICQ bomb with
1,000,000 messages like:
"Did you even tried to clean your ass with just one arm?"
Don't worry, my connection is too fast to send all this!
